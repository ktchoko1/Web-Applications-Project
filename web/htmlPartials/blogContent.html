<h2>Homework 1: Web Proposal</h2>

<p>
    I start working in web development, when I took cis 3344 (client side side scripting) last semester. it seems  pretty much cool and easier than software
    development in my view but require discipline and  practices . I'am building on the foundation laid by ci3344. htlm, css, javaScript, jqquery, AngularJS are some of the skills that I gained, I am not expert 
    yet but moving in that direction.
</p>

<h2>Homework 3: JSP Home Page</h2>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to create a home page that employs code reuse. The hardest part of 
    this was floating one  collection of left and the other right. it was confusing, I finally got it. I was not  respecting the requirer oder in the body part of the html.
    Opacity, rounded conner, and text shadow are some of the advanced css style that have been used.
